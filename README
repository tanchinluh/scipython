scipython is an interface to Python from Scilab.
It allows to call and manipulate almost any Python function, object, or data from the Scilab interpreter.

pyImport math;
a = math.sqrt(16);

scipython embeds Python 2.7 with numpy, and uses it if no other installation of Python is detected on the user's system.

The [tutorial](http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/pims/page/Tutorial) explains how to use scipython.
